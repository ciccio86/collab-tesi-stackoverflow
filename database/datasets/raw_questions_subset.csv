This was one I was dealing with at the time, to solve this problem: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1053 [continues] [continued] However, aside from that specific purpose (which is kinda frivolous anyway), this question itself is frivolous, and was not intended to be a serious question at all. In fact, of the 4 questions I've so for posted, only one is serious. :-P @erik: Not all languages have a built-in constant like `M_PI`. I was trying to find an \"authoritative\" way to get a (floating-point) value of pi that (in theory) works across a variety of languages (and/or their built-in libraries). My current preferred method is using `atan2(0, -1)`, but perhaps there are better ways. @Doorhandle Well, you're talking to [user #3](http://codegolf.stackexchange.com/users/3) on [Code Golf SE](http://codegolf.stackexchange.com/), and the poster of [Stack Overflow code golf](http://stackoverflow.com/q/62188/13), so. ;-) @Zeus In this specific case, my question was actually intended to be a \"fun\" micro-optimisation question (which, these days, would probably be a better fit for [Programming Puzzles & Code Golf](http://codegolf.stackexchange.com/)), but the general premise of \"fastest way to calculate pi\" seemed to be useful enough to keep this question here. So, at some stage, I will probably reevaluate whether I should just accept the best algorithmic answer (probably nlucaroni's one), without regard to whether it's related to micro-optimisation. @HopelessN00b In the dialect of English I speak, \"optimisation\" is [spelt](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/spelt#Verb) with an \"s\", not a \"z\" (which is pronounced as \"zed\", BTW, not \"zee\" ;-)).

Sure, it's newer, considerably better at certain things, and when used correctly speeds development time, but there's nothing we can't do in Visual Basic 6.0 that we need to be able to do.

For various reasons you don't want those IO operations to fail, so if you detect that they fail you retry them and you keep retrying them until they succeed or you reach a timeout. I already have a convenient RetryTimer class which I can instantiate and use to sleep the current thread between retries and determine when the timeout period has elapsed, etc.</p>&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;<p>The problem is that you have a bunch of IO operations in several methods of this class, and you need to wrap each of them in try-catch / retry logic.</p>&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;<p>Here's an example code snippet:</p>&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;<pre><code>RetryTimer fileIORetryTimer = new RetryTimer(TimeSpan.FromHours(10));<br>bool success = false;<br>while (!success)<br>{<br>    try<br>    {<br>        // do some file IO which may succeed or fail<br>        success = true;<br>    }<br>    catch (IOException e)<br>    {<br>        if (fileIORetryTimer.HasExceededRetryTimeout)<br>        {<br>            throw e;<br>        }<br>        fileIORetryTimer.SleepUntilNextRetry();<br>    }<br>}<br></code></pre>&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;<p>So, how do you avoid duplicating most of this code for every file IO operation throughout the class? My solution was to use anonymous delegate blocks and a single method in the class which executed the delegate block passed to it. This allowed me to do things like this in other methods:</p>&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;<pre><code>this.RetryFileIO( delegate()<br>    {<br>        // some code block<br>    } );<br></code></pre>&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;<p>I like this somewhat, but it leaves a lot to be desired.

Additionally, it is easier to create and manage smaller DataContext files than one big one. The thing that I would lose is that there would be some distant sections of the database that would not be navigable through LinqToSql (even though a chain of relationships connects them in the actual database). Additionally, there would be some table classes that would exist in more than one DataContext.</p>&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;<p>Any thoughts or experience on whether multiple DataContexts (corresponding to DB namespaces) are appropriate in place of (or in addition to) one very large DataContext class (corresponding to the whole DB)?</p>";"<asp.net><.net><linq-to-sql><datacontext>";"2008-08-18 00:00:00";"0";"";"yes"

Short version: I need some way to update the page ViewState after an async callback has been made, to reflect any state changes the server made during the async call. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>This seems to be a common problem, but I will describe my scenario to help explain:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I have a grid-like control which has some JavaScript enhancements - namely, the ability to drag and drop columns and rows. When a column or row is dropped into a new position, an AJAX method is invoked to notify the control server-side and fire a corresponding server-side event (\"OnColumnMoved\" or \"OnRowMoved\").</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>ASP.NET AJAX calls, by default, send the entire page as the request. That way the page goes through a complete lifecycle, viewstate is persisted and the state of the control is restored before the RaiseCallbackEvent method is invoked.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>However, since the AJAX call does not update the page, the ViewState reflects the <em>original</em> state of the control, even after the column or row has been moved. So the second time a client-side action occurs, the AJAX request goes to the server and the page &amp; control are built back up again to reflect the <em>first</em> state of the control, not the state after the first column or row was moved.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>This problem extends to many implications. For example if we have a client-side/AJAX action to add a new item to the grid, and then a row is dragged, the grid is built server-side with one less item than on the client-side.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>And finally &amp; most seriously for my specific example, the actual data source object we are acting upon is stored in the page ViewState. That was a design decision to allow keeping a stateful copy of the manipulated data which can either be committed to DB after many manipulations or discarded if the user backs out. That is very difficult to change.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>So, again, I need a way for the page ViewState to be updated on callback after the AJAX method is fired.</p>&#xA;";"<asp.net><ajax><asp.net-ajax><viewstate>";"2008-08-09 00:00:00";"0";"";"yes"

I am migrating to JXTA 2.5 and in the process I am trying to clean up a lot of my use of JXTA. For the most part, I approached JXTA with a \"just make it work\" attitude. I used it to jumpstart creating and managing my peer-to-peer overlay network and providing basic communication services. I would like to use it in a more \"JXTA\" way since I am making changes to move to 2.5 anyway.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>My first step would be a basic creation of a custom PeerGroup. I see some new new mechanisms that are using the META-INF.services infrastructure of Java. Should I be listing a related PeerGroup implementing object here with a GUID in net.jxta.platform.Module? As I understand it, if I do this, when a group with a spec ID matching the GUID is encountered and joined or created it should automatically use the matching object. I should be able to just manually tie a PeerGroup object to the group but this new method using META-INF seems to be a lot easier to manage.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Does anyone have any pointers or examples of using this infrastructure for PeerGroup implementation?

As I see it there are two ways to accomplish this.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>1) Adapt the trigger table to store two extra parameters.  One being \"Is this time-based or manually added?\" and a nullable field to store the timing details (exact format to be determined).

When a node is selected, the app brings that node's corresponding container control to the front, moves it to the right position, and maximizes it in the main window. This seems really, really clunky while designing it. It basically means I have tons of container controls beyond the edge of the main window during design time that I have to keep scrolling the main window over to in order to work with them.

As the user changes settings using the app's UI (clicking checkboxes, choosing radio buttons, etc.), I plan to be writing those changes out to the AppSettings. At the same time, while the program is running I plan to be accessing the AppSettings constantly from a process that will be constantly processing data. Changes to settings via the UI need to affect the data processing in real-time, which is why the process will be accessing the AppSettings constantly.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Is this a good idea with regard to performance? Using AppSettings is supposed to be \"the right way\" to store and access configuration settings when writing .Net apps, but I worry that this method wasn't intended for a constant load (at least in terms of settings being constantly read).</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>If anyone has experience with this, I would greatly appreciate the input.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>Update:</strong> I should probably clarify a few points.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>This is not a web application, so connecting a database to the application might be overkill simply for storing configuration settings. This is a Windows Forms application.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>According to the MSDN documention, the ConfigurationManager is for storing not just application level settings, but user settings as well. (Especially important if, for instance, the application is installed as a partial-trust application.)</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>Update 2:</strong> I accepted lomaxx's answer because Properties does indeed look like a good solution, without having to add any additional layers to my application (such as a database). When using Properties, it already does all the caching that others suggested. This means any changes and subsequent reads are all done in memory, making it extremely fast. Properties only writes the changes to disk when you explicitly tell it to. This means I can make changes to the config settings on-the-fly at run time and then only do a final save out to disk when the program exits.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Just to verify it would actually be able to handle the load I need, I did some testing on my laptop and was able to do 750,000 reads and 7,500 writes per second using Properties.

But when using a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer\">REST</a> or Rails-like URL scheme for object instances, I'd then end up with URLs like this:</p>&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;<pre><code>http://example.com/user/783<br></code></pre>&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;<p>And then the assumption is that there are also users with IDs of 782, 781, ..., 2, and 1. Assuming that the web app in question is secure enough to prevent people entering other numbers to view other users without authorization, a simple sequentially-assigned surrogate key also \"leaks\" the total number of instances (older than this one), in this case users, which might be privileged information. (For instance, I am user #726 in stackoverflow.)</p>&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;<p>Would a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uuid\">UUID</a>/GUID be a better solution? Then I could set up URLs like this:</p>&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;<pre><code>http://example.com/user/035a46e0-6550-11dd-ad8b-0800200c9a66<br></code></pre>&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;<p>Not exactly succinct, but there's less implied information about users on display. Sure, it smacks of \"security through obscurity\" which is no substitute for proper security, but it seems at least a little more secure.</p>&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;<p>Is that benefit worth the cost and complexity of implementing UUIDs for web-addressable object instances? I think that I'd still want to use integer columns as database PKs just to speed up joins.</p>&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;<p>There's also the question of in-database representation of UUIDs. I know MySQL stores them as 36-character strings. Postgres seems to have a more efficient internal representation (128 bits?) but I haven't tried it myself. Anyone have any experience with this?</p>&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;<hr>&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;<p>Update: for those who asked about just using the user name in the URL (e.g., http://example.com/user/yukondude), that works fine for object instances with names that are unique, but what about the zillions of web app objects that can really only be identified by number?

The current code can be found <a href=\"http://github.com/dbr/tvdb_api/tree/master/tvdb_api.py\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.</p>&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;<p>It grabs data from the API as requested, and has to store the data somehow, and make it available by doing:</p>&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;<pre><code>print tvdbinstance[1][23]['episodename'] # get the name of episode 23 of season 1<br></code></pre>&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;<p>What is the \"best\" way to abstract this data within the Tvdb() class?</p>&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;<p>I originally used a extended Dict() that automatically created sub-dicts (so you could do <code>x[1][2][3][4] = \"something\"</code> without having to do <code>if x[1].has_key(2): x[1][2] = []</code> and so on)</p>&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;<p>Then I just stored the data by doing <code>self.data[show_id][season_number][episode_number][attribute_name] = \"something\"</code></p>&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;<p>This worked okay, but there was no easy way of checking if x[3][24] was supposed to exist or not (so I couldn't raise the season_not_found exception)</p>&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;<p>Currently it's using four classes. ShowContainer, Show, Season and Episode. Each one is a very basic dict, which I can easily add extra functionality in (the search() function on Show() for example). Each has a <code>__setitem__</code>, <code>__getitem_</code> and <code>has_key</code></p>&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;<p>This works mostly fine, I can check in Shows if it has that season in it's self.data dict, if not, raise season_not_found. Check in Season() if it has that episode and so on.</p>&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;<p>The problem now is it's presenting itself as a dict, but doesn't have all the functionality, and because I'm overriding the <em>_getitem_</em> and <em>_setitem_</em> functions, it's easy to accidently recursively call <em>_getitem_</em> (so I'm not sure if extending the Dict class will cause problems)</p>&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;<p>The other slight problem is adding data into the dict is a lot more work than the old Ddict method (which was <code>self.data[seas_no][ep_no]['attribute'] = 'something'</code>). See _setItem and _setData. It's not too bad, since it's currently only a read-only API interface (so the users of the API should only ever retrieve data, not add more), but it's hardly.. elegant..</p>&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;<p>I think the series-of-classes system is probably the best way, but does anyone have a better idea for storing the data?

"6371";"2008-08-08 20:50:02";"How do you manage databases in development, test, and production?";"<p>I've had a hard time trying to find good examples of how to manage database schemas and data between development, test, and production servers.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Here's our setup. Each developer has a virtual machine running our app and the MySQL database. It is their personal sandbox to do whatever they want. Currently, developers will make a change to the SQL schema and do a dump of the database to a text file that they commit into SVN.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>We're wanting to deploy a continuous integration development server that will always be running the latest committed code. If we do that now, it will reload the database from SVN for each build.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>We have a test (virtual) server that runs \"release candidates.\" Deploying to the test server is currently a very manual process, and usually involves me loading the latest SQL from SVN and tweaking it. Also, the data on the test server is inconsistent. You end up with whatever test data the last developer to commit had on his sandbox server.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Where everything breaks down is the deployment to production. Since we can't overwrite the live data with test data, this involves manually re-creating all the schema changes. If there were a large number of schema changes or conversion scripts to manipulate the data, this can get really hairy.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>If the problem was just the schema, It'd be an easier problem, but there is \"base\" data in the database that is updated during development as well, such as meta-data in security and permissions tables.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>This is the biggest barrier I see in moving toward continuous integration and one-step-builds. How do <strong><em>you</em></strong> solve it?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<hr>&#xA;&#xA;<p>A follow-up question: how do you track database versions so you know which scripts to run to upgrade a given database instance? Is a version table like Lance mentions below the standard procedure?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<hr>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Thanks for the reference to Tarantino. I'm not in a .NET environment, but I found their <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/tarantino/wiki/DatabaseChangeManagement\">DataBaseChangeMangement wiki page</a> to be very helpful. Especially this <a href=\"http://tarantino.googlecode.com/svn/docs/Database-Change-Management.ppt\">Powerpoint Presentation (.ppt)</a></p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I'm going to write a Python script that checks the names of <code>*.sql</code> scripts in a given directory against a table in the database and runs the ones that aren't there in order based on a integer that forms the first part of the filename. If it is a pretty simple solution, as I suspect it will be, then I'll post it here.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<hr>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I've got a working script for this. It handles initializing the DB if it doesn't exist and running upgrade scripts as necessary. There are also switches for wiping an existing database and importing test data from a file. It's about 200 lines, so I won't post it (though I might put it on pastebin if there's interest).</p>&#xA;";"<mysql><svn>";"2008-08-13 00:00:00";"0";"";"yes"

I am running on Ubuntu Hardy Heron, upgraded from Gutsy Gibbon.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Is there a configuration file I can update to tell the JRE to use Pacific with all the associated daylight savings time information?  The time on my machine shows correctly, so it doesn't seem to be an OS-wide misconfiguration.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<hr>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Ok, here's an update. A coworker suggested I update JAVA_OPTS in my /etc/profile to include \"-Duser.timezone=US/Pacific\", which worked (I also saw CATALINA_OPTS, which I updated as well). Actually, I just exported the change into the variables rather than use the new /etc/profile (a reboot later will pick up the changes and I will be golden).</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>However, I still think there is a better solution... there should be a configuration for Java somewhere that says what timezone it is using, or how it is grabbing the timezone. If someone knows such a setting, that would be awesome, but for now this is a decent workaround.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<hr>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I am using 1.5, and it is most definitely a DST problem.  As you can see, the time zone is set to not use daylight savings.  My belief is it is generically set to -8 offset rather than the specific Pacific timezone.  Since the generic -8 offset has no daylight savings info, it's of course not using it, but the question is, where do I tell Java to use Pacific time zone when it starts up?  I'm NOT looking for a programmatic solution, it should be a configuration solution.</p>&#xA;";"<java><linux><timezone>";"2008-08-09 00:00:00";"0";"";"yes"

A click or move on the screen is still considered a \"Mouse\" event.  It was done this way so that code could port over from full Windows easily.  And this is not a Windows Mobile specific issue.  The TextBox control on Windows does not have native mouse events either.  I just happened to be using Windows Mobile in this case.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Edit:  And on a side note...as Windows Mobile is built of the WindowsCE core which is often used for embedded desktop systems and Slim Terminal Services clients or \"WinTerms\" it has support for a hardware mouse and has for a long time.

One thread will sequentially read fileA while the other thread will sequentially read fileB.  There is no locking or communication between the threads, both are sequentially reading as fast as they can, and both are immediately discarding the data they read.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Our experience with this setup on Windows is very poor.  The combined throughput of the two threads is in the order of 2-3 MiB/sec.  The drive seems to be spending most of its time seeking backwards and forwards between the two files, presumably reading very little after each seek.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>If we disable one of the threads and temporarily look at the performance of a single thread then we get much better bandwidth (~45 MiB/sec for this machine).  So clearly the bad two-thread performance is an artefact of the OS disk scheduler.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>Is there anything we can do to improve the concurrent thread read performance?</strong>  Perhaps by using different APIs or by tweaking the OS disk scheduler parameters in some way.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Some details:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The files are in the order of 2 GiB each on a machine with 2GiB of RAM.  For the purpose of this question we consider them not to be cached and perfectly defragmented.  We have used defrag tools and rebooted to ensure this is the case.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>We are using no special APIs to read these files.  The behaviour is repeatable across various bog-standard APIs such as Win32's CreateFile, C's fopen, C++'s std::ifstream, Java's FileInputStream, etc.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Each thread spins in a loop making calls to the read function.  We have varied the number of bytes requested from the API each iteration from values between 1KiB up to 128MiB.  Varying this has had no effect, so clearly the amount the OS is physically reading after each disk seek is not dictated by this number.  This is exactly what should be expected.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The dramatic difference between one-thread and two-thread performance is repeatable across Windows 2000, Windows XP (32-bit and 64-bit), Windows Server 2003, and also with and without hardware RAID5.</p>&#xA;";"<windows><multithreading><file-io>";"2009-01-04 00:00:00";"0";"";"yes"

In your business logic layer you have described your business objects: getters, setters, accessors, and so on... you get the idea. The interface to the business logic layer guarantees safe usage of the business logic, so all the methods and accessors you call will validate input. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>This great when you first write the UI code, because you have a neatly defined interface that you can trust.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>But here comes the tricky part, when you start writing the data access layer, the interface to the business logic does not accommodate your needs. You need to have more accessors and getters to set fields which are/used to be hidden. Now you are forced to erode the interface of your business logic; now it is possible set fields from the UI layer, which the UI layer has no business setting. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Because of the changes needed for the data access layer, the interface to the business logic has eroded to the point where it is possible to even set the business logic with invalid data. Thus, the interface does not guarantee safe usage anymore.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I hope I explained the problem clearly enough.

That would be nice and acceptable though none of them can display an SVG image from the given markup.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>So the question actually consists of several parts:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ol>&#xA;<li>Are there any cross-browser Javascript libraries that display vector graphics from given markup (not obligatory SVG) and offer availability to attach to DOM events?</li>&#xA;<li>If there are not, which of the most pupular browser-embedded technologies would be most suitable for doing such a task? I can choose from Flex/Flash, Java applet. Silverlight is not an option because of Windows lock-in.</li>&#xA;</ol>&#xA;&#xA;<p>[<strong>EDIT</strong>] Thank you all for your comments/suggestions. Below are just some my random notes/conclusions on this matter:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ul>&#xA;<li>The level of interactivity I need is ability to detect DOM events on the vector image being displayed - mouseover, mouseout, click etc. - and ability to react on them like changing background color, displaying dialog etc.</li>&#xA;<li>The idea of sticking with SVG format is quite well as it is native on many browsers except the most popular one - IE. After some experimenting with displaying dynamic SVG I realized that IE version 7 the most problematic. There's too much hassle because of browser incompatibilities.</li>&#xA;<li>Cake seems a great Javascript framework, though I could not get the examples working on IE7.</li>&#xA;<li>Java Applets - I liked that idea the most as I though I could use the Apache Batik library, a quality SVG renderer. However, Batik is very big library and I cannot afford deploying an applet that weights few megabytes.</li>&#xA;<li>I decided to stick with the Flex option. I found a nice vector graphics library <a href=\"http://www.degrafa.com/\">Degrafa</a>. It uses its own markup format however it recognizes SVG path notation, so in my case it is going to be quite easy to transform my SVGs using XSLT or just parsing them.</li>&#xA;</ul>&#xA;&#xA;<p>[<strong>EDIT 2</strong>] Some more comments appeared. I'd like to clarify that by \"Windows lock-in\" I mean the situation that Silverlight would normally run on Windows, more specifically, IE. I doubt it is an accepted solution (like Flash or Java Applet, for instance) on other systems. Yes, I have no doubt that one <em>is able to</em> launch Silverlight app on any system though I fear it would be too much effort for an average user.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>@Akira: Have you had any problems with those \"SVG renderers\" on IE7?

There is a process that is responsible for playing a certain wave file on this device's wave out (ISDN connection is made at startup and made persistent). The scenario is easy, whenever needed the process calls <code>waveOutWrite()</code> on the previously opened wave device (everything initialized without any problems of course) and a callback function waits for <code>MM_WOM_DONE</code> msg to know that the playback has been finished. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Since a few days however (nothing changed neither in the process nor the machine) the <code>MM_WOM_DONE</code> message has been coming immediately after calling <code>waveOutWrite()</code> even though the wave lasts a couple of seconds. Again no error is reported, it looks like the file was played but had zero length (which is not the case). I am also sure that <code>waveOutReset()</code> was not called by my process (it would also trigger sending the mentioned message). I have already used to have some strange problems in the past that where solved simply by reinstalling TAPI drivers. This time for some reason it is problematic for me to perform that once again and I am trying more analytical approach :). Any suggestions what might cause such a behavior? Maybe something on the other end of the ISDN line?</p>&#xA;";"<c++><windows><waveout>";"Null";"0";"";"no"

Currently, if two users open the same document, then modify it and save the changes, the document's state will be undefined (either the first user's changes are saved permanently, or the second's). This is entirely unsatisfactory. I considered two possibilities to solve this problem:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The first is to lock the document when it is opened by someone the first time, and unlock it when it is closed. But if the network connection to the server is suddenly interrupted, the document would stay in a forever-locked state. The obvious solution is to send regular pings to the server. If the server doesn't receive K pings in a row (K > 1) from a particular client, documents locked by this client are unlocked. If that client re-appears, documents are locked again, if someone hadn't already locked them. This could also help if the client application (running in web browser) is terminated unexpectedly, making it impossible to send a 'quitting, unlock my documents' signal to the server.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The second is to store multiple versions of the same document saved by different users. If changes to the document are made in rapid succession, the system would offer either to merge versions or to select a preferred version. To optimize storage space, only document diffs should be kept (just like source control software).</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>What method should I choose, taking into consideration that the connection to the server might <em>sometimes</em> be slow and unresponsive? How should the parameters (ping interval, rapid succession interval) be determined?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>P.S.

The events for the .drag elements are working.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>&lt;title&gt;Untitled Page&lt;/title&gt;&#xA;&lt;script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"/SDI/includes/mootools-1.2.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&#xA;&lt;script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"/SDI/includes/mootools-1.2-more.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&#xA;&lt;script type=\"text/javascript\" charset=\"utf-8\"&gt;&#xA;    window.addEvent('domready', function() {&#xA;        var fx = [];&#xA;        $$('#draggables div').each(function(drag){&#xA;            new Drag.Move(drag, {&#xA;                droppables: $$('#droppables div'),&#xA;                onDrop: function(element, droppable){&#xA;                    if(!droppable) {&#xA;                    }&#xA;                    else {&#xA;                        element.setStyle('background-color', '#1d1d20');&#xA;                    }&#xA;                    element.dispose();&#xA;                },&#xA;                onEnter: function(element, droppable){&#xA;                    element.setStyle('background-color', '#ffffff');&#xA;                },&#xA;                onLeave: function(element, droppable){&#xA;                    element.setStyle('background-color', '#000000');&#xA;                }&#xA;            });&#xA;        });&#xA;&#xA;        $$('#droppables div').each(function(drop, index){&#xA;            drop.addEvents({&#xA;                'enter': function(el, obj){&#xA;                    drop.setStyle('background-color', '#78ba91');&#xA;                },&#xA;                'leave': function(el, obj){&#xA;                    drop.setStyle('background-color', '#1d1d20');&#xA;                },&#xA;                'drop': function(el, obj){&#xA;                    el.remove();&#xA;                }&#xA;            });&#xA;        });&#xA;    });&#xA;&lt;/script&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;form id=\"form1\" runat=\"server\"&gt;&#xA;&lt;div&gt;&#xA;    &lt;div id=\"draggables\"&gt;&#xA;    &lt;div class=\"drag\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&#xA;    &lt;div class=\"drag\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&#xA;    &lt;div class=\"drag\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&#xA;    &lt;div class=\"drag\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&#xA;    &lt;div class=\"drag\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&#xA;    &lt;div class=\"drag\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&#xA;    &lt;div class=\"drag\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&#xA;    &lt;div class=\"drag\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&#xA;    &lt;div class=\"drag\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&#xA;    &lt;div class=\"drag\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;div id=\"droppables\"&gt;&#xA;    &lt;div class=\"drop\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&#xA;    &lt;div class=\"drop\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&#xA;    &lt;div class=\"drop\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&#xA;    &lt;div class=\"drop\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&#xA;    &lt;div class=\"drop\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&#xA;    &lt;div class=\"drop\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&#xA;&lt;/form&gt;&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;";"<javascript><drag-and-drop><mootools>";"2008-08-19 00:00:00";"0";"";"yes"

Mostly I've written database driven applications, but occasionally, even those require some file io.

There will be a fair bit of overlap, but the point is to define all of the subtle different variants that are out there.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>For example: </p>&#xA;&#xA;<ol>&#xA;<li>Read/Write a text file from/to a single String.</li>&#xA;<li>Read a text file line by line.</li>&#xA;<li>Read/Write a binary file from/to a single byte[].</li>&#xA;<li>Read a binary file into a byte[] of size x, one chunk at a time.</li>&#xA;</ol>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The goal is to show concise ways to do each of these. Samples do not need to handle missing files or other errors, as that is generally domain specific.

It uses many, many threads, but with no apparent design or common architectural principles.  Every developer had his own style of multithreaded programming, so some threads communicate with one another using queues, some lock data with mutexes, some lock with semaphores, some use operating-system IPC mechanisms for intra-process communications.  There is no design documentation, and comments are sparse.  It's a mess, and it seems that whenever we try to refactor the code or add new functionality, we introduce deadlocks or other problems.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>So, does anyone know of any tools or techniques that would help to analyze and document all the interactions between threads?
